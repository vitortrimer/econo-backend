# Econos Backend :moneybag:

Hello! I'm [Vitor Trimer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitor-trimer-272152153/), and this is the backend of my Econos project.

Econos is a study purpose project, which consists in a website that helps the user to control their expenses.

It was actually going to be a really simple project, just for practicing, but i am always afraid of losing the project before it is complete, so i decided to create a repo for this.

Disclaimer: I'm a frontend developer trying to get better at backend development, some things may not be so correct or optimized. If you have any suggestions, you can open a pull request for this project! :smile:

As I am working alone in a project that will not be published, I'm not following the right gitflow model, sorry for that.
